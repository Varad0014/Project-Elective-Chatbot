                         The principal objective of IKS research Lab at IIITB is to investigate; conduct critical studies; highlight the strength of IKS; exploit its fullest potential; showcasing its significance for sustainable environment, love for nature, holistic ways of living, health conscious that ultimately leads to quality life for everyone in the plane.\n\nBackground and Relevance \n\nIndian Knowledge System (IKS) suggests a number of thematic areas of IKS, where lot of research and studies are needed. This includes study of health and wellbeing, and consciousness; art and culture; mathematics and astronomy etc. Community wellness and quality of life are very important for any individual, especially in rapidly changing and technology driven society and world. Current literature suggests work on using AI for healthcare applications. The focus of the work has not been exploiting the IKS domains, Yoga, consciousness and mindfulness practices and thus the proposed work to be carried out in the IKS Lab has relevance in context of National Education Policy of Govt. of India (NEP2020) as well as IKS for holistic development of students and improved wellness of community.\n\nUnder Ministry of Education, Government of India has established IKS division with a vision to promote interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research on all aspects of IKS, and disseminate IKS knowledge for further innovations and societal applications. The IKS division promotes research and critical studies in various IKS domains aiming at original, serious, and deep scholarly research in IKS and rejuvenate IKS research in India. IKS division includes traditional knowledge in mathematics and astronomy; chemical and material science; health, wellness, and consciousness studies; political and economic thoughts; arts, traditions, and rich culture etc.\n\nContribution to the IKS Mission of India\n\nNational Education Policy 2020 (NEP2020) emphasizes much on Indian Knowledge System (IKS) for holistic development of students. The traditional knowledge of medicine, mindfulness practices (Vipassana), heritage etc. has to be provided to the students so that understanding the importance of IKS fields for excellent wellbeing is developed, in addition to all around professional development. So, this AI intervention-based study aims at fulling the most important expectation envisaged in NEP2020.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nPeople Working in Lab\n\n1.\u00a0G.

Research has shown that different meditation techniques can elicit specific brainwave patterns. For example, practices like mindfulness meditation often lead to an increase in alpha waves, associated with relaxed attention, while focused attention practices may enhance beta wave activity, associated with concentration and alertness.\n\nEffects of Meditation on EEG Signals: Regular meditation practice has been found to have various effects on EEG signals. Long-term meditators tend to exhibit alterations in baseline brainwave activity, including increased alpha and theta waves, as well as enhanced coherence and synchrony between different brain regions. These changes indicate a state of calmness, mental clarity, and increased attentional abilities.\n\nMindfulness and Attention: EEG studies have shown that mindfulness meditation can enhance attentional capacities. It has been observed that experienced meditators display improved sustained attention, better ability to focus, and reduced mind-wandering. These improvements can be reflected in EEG signals, such as increased alpha power in the parietal region associated with attentional control.\n\nStates of Consciousness: EEG signals can also shed light on the different states of consciousness experienced during meditation. Deep states of meditation, such as those achieved in advanced practitioners or during transcendental experiences, may exhibit unique brainwave patterns, including increased theta and gamma activity.\n\nNeuroplasticity and Long-Term Effects: Long-term meditation practice has been linked to neuroplastic changes in the brain. EEG studies have shown alterations in cortical thickness, increased functional connectivity, and changes in brain regions associated with attention, emotion regulation, and self-awareness. These findings suggest that meditation can have lasting effects on brain structure and function.\n\nBrain Mapping\u00a0 and EEG Electrode Localization\n\nEEG (electroencephalography) channel localization is an important step in brain mapping, which involves identifying the specific regions of the brain associated with each EEG channel. EEG channel localization is typically performed using a combination of anatomical knowledge, referencing techniques, and brain imaging data. Here's an overview of the process:\n\nInternational 10-20 System: The International 10-20 System is a widely used standard for electrode placement in EEG. It defines specific positions on the scalp where electrodes are placed. The positions are determined based on a percentage of the total distance between key anatomical landmarks, such as the nasion (the bridge of the nose) and the inion (the bony prominence at the back of the head). This system provides a rough approximation of the underlying brain regions.\n\nReference Placement: EEG signals are measured with respect to a reference electrode, which serves as a baseline for the recorded activity. The choice of reference can affect the interpretation of EEG data. Common reference options include linked mastoids (located behind the ears), average reference (average of all electrodes), and bipolar reference (using adjacent electrodes as references).\n\nNeuroimaging Techniques: Neuroimaging techniques, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), can provide structural and functional information about the brain. These imaging modalities can help in localizing the brain regions corresponding to specific EEG channels. Core registration techniques can align EEG electrode positions with the structural images to aid in accurate localization.\n\nSource Localization: Advanced techniques, such as source localization, can be used to estimate the neural generators of EEG signals. Source localization methods attempt to identify the specific brain regions responsible for generating the observed EEG activity. These methods utilize mathematical models and algorithms to estimate the underlying neural sources based on the recorded scalp EEG data.\n\nIt's important to note that EEG channel localization provides a rough estimation of brain activity localization. While it can give valuable information about the spatial distribution of EEG signals, it doesn't provide precise localization down to individual neurons.\n\n\u00a0\n                        \n                                            \n                            Work of Internships\n\n\n Machine learning approach for mind-wandering detection during meditation using EEG signals.\n Study on effectiveness of Heartfulness meditation in reduction of perceived stress and enhancement of life satisfaction\n Exploring the impact of traditional meditational schemes on human brain using EEG signals\n Exploratory analysis of various meditational practices using psychometric data\n Localization of EEG channels for various brain activity detection\n\n\n\n\n1.
