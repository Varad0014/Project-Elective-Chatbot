(I.M.Tech.) programme in 2012. The Integrated M.Tech. programme is a 5-year integrated programme intended for students who have completed or are completing Plus Two of schooling (or equivalent). At the end of five years of the programme, successful students get dual degrees of B.Tech. and M.Tech.\u00a0\u00a0A new curriculum has been followed since 2020 that allows dual specialization for both CSE and ECE students. Students in both CSE and ECE branches can specialize in the below listed areas: AIML (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning), TSCD (Theory and Systems for Computing and Data), NC (Networking and Communication), VLSI (VLSI Systems),\u00a0Cyber Security (CY) and DT (Digital Society).\n\nThe I.M.Tech. CSE/ECE is a ten-semester programme where the first eight semesters constitute academic course work. During the ninth semester, students are given an option to work on a project or choose course work which will help in pursuing higher studies. In the 10th semester, the student may opt for thesis or internship in a well-recognized organization.\n\n[Click here\u00a0to view iM.Tech 2022 Admissions Summary]\n\nClick here to view Integarted MTech Handbook\n\n\u00a0\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                                                    Eligibility\n                                                    Selection Procedure\n                                                    How to Apply\n                                                    Course Fee\n                                                    Information Brochure and Handbook\n                                                    Important Dates\n                                                    Scholarships\n                                                    Gender Diversity\n                                            \n\t\t\t\t\t                                            \n                            Minimum Requirements\n\nThe minimum qualification required for admission to the Integrated M.Tech. programme at IIITB is a first-class in 10 + 2 (or equivalent) with Mathematics as one of the subjects. Students expecting to complete the minimum requirement by September 2023 may also apply.\n                        \n                                            \n                            The current year admissions to the I.M.Tech. programme is solely based on the NTA Rank in the JEE Main 2023 exam, which is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) (this criterion is subject to the minimum qualification requirements mentioned previously).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nChoice of Branch: IIITB offers admission to two branches Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE).\n\n\n Any I.M.Tech. applicant is automatically considered for admission to both the branches (CSE and ECE) if there are vacant seats in both these branches during the turn of the applicant. The applicant is offered both these branches but has to choose one branch only by paying the fees and indicating the choice of branch on or before the date mentioned in the offer letter. Failure to pay the fees or confirm the choice of branch before the deadline will result in the cancellation of the offer and the applicant will not be eligible for further admission rounds except the Special Admission Round (see Important Dates section).\n During the turn of the applicant if there are vacant seats in only one branch (for example, CSE), then the applicant is offered that particular branch only (for example, CSE).

Failure to pay the fees before the deadline will result in the cancellation of the offer made for that particular branch (for example, CSE) and will not be eligible to get any offer for the same branch (for example, CSE) in further admission rounds except the Special Admission Round (see Important Dates section). However, the candidate will still be eligible for admission to the other branch (for example, ECE) if there are vacant seats for that branch in further rounds including the Special Admission Round.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere is no fixed cut-off of NTA rank for the I.M.Tech. programme.\u00a0In 2022, admission offers were made up to NTA Rank 8997 for CSE and 18457 for ECE.

This combination of faculty and students, along with regularly updated curriculum, Labs, teaching and research create the academic and hands on platform for a student. The learning process in IIITB is an experience for life time as you build your career.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, Bangalore being the Silicon Valley of India, with a large number of IT industries and R&D Labs from multinational companies as well as the government support, the students get vast exposure by interacting with eminent people in workshops/conferences and work with them during internship.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlong with academics, the campus is also active in non-academic events like sports, music, drama. etc., to encourage holistic growth of a student.
