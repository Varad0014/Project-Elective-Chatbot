(NCL) in IIIT-Bangalore mainly focuses on\n  various R&D areas related to broadband wireless network. Recent major\n  areas of work include Power Saving in devices and base stations by New\n  Protocols, multi-Radio Access Technology (RAT selection), Cognitive Radio,\n  TVWS, scheduling schemes in LTE-A and Beyond, MAC for IoT devices as well as\n  secured Transport layer. This lab was created in Jan. 2007 by research fund\n  from Hewlett Packard, Motorola India Research Labs. Later on the Lab received\n  research funding from Microsoft, Nokia, Intel, Siemens, DeitY-Government of\n  India to work on various challenging problems in niche areas of broadband\n  Wireless Network. This lab has already produced four PhDs and nine MS by\n  Research (MSR) theses over last 8 years. Seven students are pursuing PhD. \n  \n  Current ongoing sponsored research activities are:\n  \n  1. IoT, SDN and Secured Technologies for Smart Building \ufffd Sponsored by\n  Cognizant Technologies and Dept. of Electronics and Information Technology\n  (DeitY), Govt of India. \n  \n  2.
