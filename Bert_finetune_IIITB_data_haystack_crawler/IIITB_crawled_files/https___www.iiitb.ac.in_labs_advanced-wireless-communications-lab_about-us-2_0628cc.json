Emphasis will be on building new wireless communication systems and development of new technologies with their performance analyses. We focus mostly on physical layer concepts.\n\nThrough MS by Research, and Ph.D programs, students will get trained in designing new communication technologies from scratch with detailed mathematical analysis, as applicable. This will lead to skill development which will satisfy academia and industry needs altogether. Motivated iMTech and M.Tech. students interested to work on 5G physical layer and completed Digital communication (EC-306) and Wireless Communication (NC-827) courses are welcome to do thesis with the coordinator.\n\nCoordinator\nDr. Priyanka Das\nAssistant Professor, IIITB\nEmail: priyanka.das@iiitb.ac.in\n\n\n\n\nRecent News\n\n\n\n\t[June 2023]\u00a0Our paper on 'Sparse Bayesian Learning-Based Channel Estimation for IRS-Aided Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO Systems,' accepted for publication in\u00a0Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), Toronto, Canada\n\t[June 2022] Our paper on 'Secrecy Performance with Optimal Relay and Antenna Selection in Spectrum-Sharing Networks,' accepted for publication in IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM), IISc, India\n\t[June 2022] Our paper on 'Outage Performance of Optimal Relay and Antenna Selection Schemes with TAS/MRC and TAS/SC for Spectrum-Sharing Network under Imperfect CSI,' accepted for publication in IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM), IISc, India\n\t[May 2022] Organised a workshop \"Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces: Fundamentals and Applications\".
