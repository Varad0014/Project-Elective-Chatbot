Our research covers both upstream (requirement and design) and downstream (testing and maintenance) SDLC activities cutting across a variety of application domains (enterprise, embedded etc). Here is a list of some of the broad areas in which our faculty members are working: Pattern oriented software engineering, software architecture, distributed software engineering, model driven software engineering (MDSE), software testing, verification and validation (V&V) of web-services and V&V of embedded software (cyber-physical systems and adaptive systems) among others.\n\t  \n   \n  \n\n", "content_type": "text", "score": null, "meta": {"url": "https://www.iiitb.ac.in/SELab/"}, "id_hash_keys": ["content"], "embedding": null, "id": "ef5fb5c1d2fcd7157595b9206382c51b"}
