The SARL lab at IIITB\n\t    \t is a joint work by IIIT-B and NIMHANS. Currently we are working on the development of neurosurgical skill automation,\n\t    \t food intake monitoring, seizure prediction, automated injection system,\n\t    \t wearable assistive upper limb rehabilitation and exoskeleton device, lower limb DVT prophylaxis device,\n\t    \t biomimetic robotic arm,\n\t    \t surgical hyperflexible probe, neurosurgical\n\t    \t microscope, Minimally invasive\n\t\tVentricular Assistive Device, Tactile educational Kit, Image guided autonomous drilling tool, Swarm robotics, and Passenger assistance system.\n\t\tThe projects in the SARL is currently funded by EHRC, MINRO, MSJE, IBM SUR, and IBM GUP.\n          \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCurrently Trending\n                 Pranav Kedia's work on \"GenGrid: A Generalised Distributed Experimental Environmental Grid for Swarm Robotics\" got accepted in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), to be held from May 30 - June 5, 2021 (Virtual Conference).\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Vinay Chandrasekhar's work on \"Design of a Device for Lower Limb Prophylaxis and Exercise\" got published in IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\tOpenings\n          \n\t\t  \t\t See new openings for prospective students and Post-Doctoral Fellows in News/Events/Openings\n\t\t \n\n         Last updated:\n            July-1-2021 by Madhav Rao)\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \u00a9 2014 Madhav Rao\n\t\t          Thanks to Jaya Sreevalsan-Nair\n\t\t          Template design by Andreas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t            Viklund / Best hosted at www.svenskadomaner.se\n\t\t      \n\t\t    \n\t\t  \n\t\t\n", "content_type": "text", "score": null, "meta": {"url": "https://www.iiitb.ac.in/sarl/sarl.html"}, "id_hash_keys": ["content"], "embedding": null, "id": "d8355694894f968a45d1392b07dc42ca"}
